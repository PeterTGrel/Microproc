MPP2 - This project was about learning the use of timers, PWM signals (created by myself)

MPP3 - The task was to measure the temperature of the microcontroller using ADC/DCA and performing a few calculations using the data (contributed: Sajeda Alsaadi, Péter Tóth, Robin Horak)

Traffic - Assignment, controlling an intersection (with state-transition table). The goal of this project is to be hardware-independent and to port it to AVR, ARM and VHDL
